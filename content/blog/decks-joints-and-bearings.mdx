Bridge decks in Florida must resist traffic wear, UV exposure, and water and chloride penetration. Durable options include cast-in-place or precast concrete decks with low-permeability mixes, sometimes supplemented by thin overlays designed to improve skid resistance and provide additional protection. Attention to deck drainage—ensuring water is collected and directed away from structural elements—plays a major role in controlling long-term degradation.\

Expansion joints and bearings are common points of distress; failed seals or clogged drainage can allow chlorides to reach substructure elements. Modern joint systems and bearing materials are selected to limit leakage, accommodate thermal and seismic movements, and facilitate future replacement. Giralt Enterprises emphasizes joint and bearing details that are both robust and maintainable, recognizing that these components often control long-term performance in Florida’s environment.

Railings, Barriers, and Ancillary Elements
Bridge railings, barriers, and pedestrian parapets in Florida must be engineered for both impact performance and severe environmental exposure. Concrete barriers with integrated or attached metal rail elements use similar durability strategies as seawalls and handrails—marine-grade concrete, corrosion-resistant reinforcing, and stainless or galvanized steel rails and hardware in coastal zones.\

Ancillary elements—lighting standards, sign structures, and utilities—also require attention to corrosion and wind loading, often using aluminum or galvanized steel with appropriate coatings. Giralt Enterprises coordinates these components with the primary bridge design so that connections and penetrations do not create weak points for water ingress or structural distress.\

Designing for Inspection and Maintenance
Florida’s experience with aging coastal infrastructure underscores the value of bridge designs that facilitate inspection, maintenance, and future rehabilitation. Clear access to critical elements, logical segmentation of protective systems (such as coatings and overlays), and provisions for future strengthening or widening can greatly reduce lifecycle costs. For example, detailing that allows deck overlays to be replaced without major structural work extends service life while minimizing traffic disruptions.
​
Giralt Enterprises integrates durability and maintainability considerations from the earliest design stages, using Florida-specific lessons learned from seawall, dock, and bridge projects to inform material choices and details. This approach supports owners in meeting performance goals under today’s conditions while accommodating the evolving climate and loading environment expected over the coming decades.
If you’d like, the next step can be to tailor each post with project photos, local case studies, or specific service descriptions (e.g., “handrail inspections in Central Florida” or “dock design on the Gulf vs. Atlantic side”) to fit Giralt Enterprises’ portfolio and target markets.
